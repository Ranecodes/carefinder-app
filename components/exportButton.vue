<!-- This component will represent the export icon/button.

Within the "ExportButton.vue" component, design the UI for the export button. 
You can use an appropriate icon library or create a custom button style.

Implement the export functionality within the "ExportButton.vue" component. When the 
button is clicked, it should convert the hospital search results into a list and generate a CSV file.

To generate the CSV file, you can utilize the existing "csv.js" utility file within 
the utils folder or create a new utility function specifically for the export functionality. 
This utility function will convert the hospital data into a CSV format and allow the user to download the file.

Pass the hospital search results data from the "search.vue" page to the "ExportButton.vue" 
component as a prop. This will enable the export button to access the data and convert it 
into the desired format.  -->
