<!-- This is a This component will represent the overlay that appears when the user clicks 
    the share icon/button.

Within the "ShareOverlay.vue" component, you can design the overlay UI and include options 
for sharing via link or email. This can involve input fields for the recipient's email address 
and a message, along with buttons to generate a shareable link or send an email.

To display the overlay, you can use a CSS technique to blur the background content and give 
focus to the overlay component. You can apply a CSS class to the root element of the "search.vue" 
page that triggers the blur effect when the share icon/button is clicked.

Implement the necessary logic in the "ShareOverlay.vue" component to handle generating shareable links 
or sending emails. This might involve making appropriate API calls or utilizing the necessary functions 
and utilities. -->
